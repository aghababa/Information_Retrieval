# Information Retrieval

This repository contains my assignmets done in Information Retrieval (CS 6550) course at university of Utah in Fall 2021. 

Codes are either in Python (both ipynb and py files) or Java. 

We have used Galago for IR tasks in this course (see: https://lemur.sourceforge.io/documentation/Galago%20Documentation.html).
