# Information Retrieval

This repository contains my assignments and labs done in Information Retrieval (CS 6550) course at University of Utah in Fall 2021. 

Codes are either in Python (both ipynb and py files) and JacaScript. 

We have used Galago for IR tasks in this course (see: https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/Galago%20Installation/ and https://lemur.sourceforge.io/documentation/Galago%20Documentation.html).


In order to use the user interface tool, one must unzip all the files in Data folder. Then running the whole project in an IDE 
like VScode will involve first running the python file and then running live server from html file.
